For now, at least...

1. Download "BarelyWorkingBuild.jar" and "MatchRecords.csv"
2. Ensure that they are in the same file directory
3. Run!

NOTE: Occassionally, the program will lag for a few seconds. So far I haven't found a pattern to it, but then again it is currently 1:30 in the morning the day of Ramp Riot. But yeah, allow for the lag, don't even try to use the EventViewer portion, because I need to actually implement that now... meaning after I sleep.
